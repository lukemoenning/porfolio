  about:
    "I'm a software engineer studying computer science and mathematics at the University of Iowa. In my free time I love playing and watching soccer, and recently I've even been involved with coaching. I also enjoy learning new skills through projects - like the fun game I hid somewhere on this website. (Hint: it's hidden where it should never be found.)",
